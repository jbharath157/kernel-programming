# Spinlocks

The most common lock in the Linux kernel is the spin lock.

Spinlocks are used to protect short code sections that comprise just a few C statements and are therefore quickly executed and exited.

A spin lock is a lock that can be held by at most one thread of execution.

---

## When the thread tries to acquire lock which is already held?

The thread busy loops/spins waiting for the lock to become available.

## When the thread tries to acquire lock which is available?

The thread acquires the lock and continues.

# Spinlock Methods

## Header File:
```c
#include <linux/spinlock.h>
```

## Data Structure:
```c
spinlock_t
```

## Methods

```c
DEFINE_SPINLOCK(my_lock);  // Equivalent to:
                           // spinlock_t my_lock = __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(my_lock);
```

From `<linux/spinlock_types.h>`:
```c
#define DEFINE_SPINLOCK(x) spinlock_t x = __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(x)
```

### ðŸ”’ To lock a spin lock:
```c
void spin_lock(spinlock_t *lock);
```

### ðŸ”“ To unlock a spin lock:
```c
void spin_unlock(spinlock_t *lock);
```

# Will spin lock exist on uniprocessor machines?

## When CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set / kernel preemption disabled

Spinlocks are defined as **empty operations** because critical sections cannot be entered by several CPUs at the same time on a uniprocessor system.

## When CONFIG_PREEMPT is set

In order to protect critical sections from **kernel preemption** (even on uniprocessor), spinlocks are redefined as:

```c
spin_lock   = preempt_disable();
spin_unlock = preempt_enable();
```

This ensures that even on a **uniprocessor**, the code within the spinlock is not preempted by another kernel thread.


## Note:

What happens if i acquire a lock which is already held by the same CPU?

**Spin locks are not recursive**

Unlike spin lock implementations in other operating systems and threading libraries, the Linux kernelâ€™s spin locks are not recursive

This means that if you attempt to acquire a lock you already hold, you will spin, waiting for yourself to release the lock.

But because you are busy spinning, you will never release the lock and you will deadlock.
